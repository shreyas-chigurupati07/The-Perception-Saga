# Mini Drone Race – The Perception Saga!
- In this project, a perception stack for DJI Tello EDU quadcopter was developed to enable precise navigation through multiple windows, whose texture and approximate dimensions are known.
- To achieve this, simulation-to-reality (sim2real) techniques (such as domain randomization) were used to generate synthetic data from blender, creating a robust training set images and labels for the neural network model.
- YOLOv8 was the chosen architecture model and it was trained to identify and segment the front window from a complex environment of multiple windows.
- Once the segmentation mask was detected, the corners were extracted and a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm is applied to calculate the relative pose of the front window which is essential for guiding the quadcopter through the windows safely.\

## Steps to run the code
- Install Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, blender python, pyquaternion, djitellopy, OpenCv, Ultralytics libraries before running the code.
- Data generation:
  - If you want to use the dataset we generated, download it from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vpTFZ2e7NAu6Ufwol3CPBNRqSzk6DJaQ/view?usp=sharing) (NOTE: size is nearly 4GB).
-  Training:
    - To train the YOLOv8 model run the `window_seg_yolov8.ipynb` file in `YOLO Model` folder and before doing that add the location to your dataset appropriately.
    - You can also use the already trained weights that gave an inference time of 33ms on Orin nano. The weights file `last.pt` is in `YOLO Model` folder. 
- Camera Calibration: Use the code in `Calibration` folder to get the camera intrinsics and distortion coefficients.
- To fly the drone (no need to do any of the above steps for doing this step):
	- Set up the tello drone and NVIDIA Jetson Orin nano
   	- On orin nano clone this repository
   	- Open the `fly_tello.py` file.
   	- Connect to the network of the tello drone and run in `repo` folder the following command:
   	  ```
	    python3 fly_tello.py
	    ```
